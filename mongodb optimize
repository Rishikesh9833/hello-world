This is a beautifully structured prompt, Rishikesh — clear, detailed, and perfectly tuned for deep technical feedback. Since you’re working under strict constraints (no new indexes), here’s a comprehensive response tailored to your goals:

⚡ Optimizing MongoDB Query Without New Indexes

🧠 Key Bottlenecks Identified

• `$lookup` on the same large collection (`Message`) without an index on `correlationId` is expensive.
• `$match` filters on non-indexed fields like `receiverName`, `dispatcherName`, and `sendersReference` slow down initial filtering.
• `$exists: false` checks are not index-supported and require full document scans.
• `$lookup` inside aggregation forces nested scans per document — brutal at scale.

🛠️ Strategy 1: Client-Side Lookup Optimization

🔄 Step-by-Step Plan

1. Chunked Fetch: Use `_id` for pagination.
2. Initial Fetch: Pull 1000 documents matching your `$match` criteria.
3. Extract `correlationId`s from these documents.
4. Client-Side Enrichment:• Query `Message` again with:{
  correlationId: { $in: [...correlationIds] },
  sendersReference: { $exists: true, $ne: "" }
}

• Build a map: `correlationId → sendersReference`
• Enrich original 1000 docs in memory.



✅ Benefits

• Avoids `$lookup` entirely.
• Reduces nested scans.
• Parallelizable on client side.
• More predictable performance.

🛠️ Strategy 2: Optimized Aggregation Pipeline

If you must stay server-side, here’s a leaner version:

[
  {
    $match: {
      dayOfYear: 213,
      cell: "vet-processing-coacs",
      receiverName: "coacsOutboundToSwift-Rec",
      dispatcherName: { $exists: false },
      sendersReference: { $exists: false }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { _id: 1 }
  },
  {
    $limit: 1000
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Message",
      let: { cid: "$correlationId" },
      pipeline: [
        {
          $match: {
            $expr: {
              $and: [
                { $eq: ["$correlationId", "$$cid"] },
                { $ne: ["$sendersReference", ""] }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        { $project: { sendersReference: 1, correlationId: 1 } },
        { $limit: 1 }
      ],
      as: "related"
    }
  },
  {
    $addFields: {
      sendersReference: {
        $arrayElemAt: ["$related.sendersReference", 0]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      correlationId: 1,
      receiverName: 1,
      attributes: 1,
      payload: 1,
      sendersReference: 1
    }
  }
]


🔧 Tweaks:

• Use `$addFields` + `$arrayElemAt` instead of `$unwind` for slightly better performance.
• Avoid `$exists: true` inside `$expr` — redundant if `$ne: ""` is used.

🧩 Chunking Strategy with `_id`

🔁 Paginate with `_id`

Use this pattern for stable chunking:

{
  _id: { $gt: lastSeenId },
  ...other match filters
}


Sort by `_id`, limit to 1000, and repeat with the last `_id` from previous batch.

---

🧠 General Performance Tips

✅ Do:

• Use `$in` with small arrays — fast if field is indexed.
• Keep `$match` early and tight.
• Use `$project` to reduce payload size.
• Use `$limit` aggressively.


❌ Avoid:

• `$lookup` on same collection without indexes.
• `$exists: false` on large datasets.
• `$unwind` unless necessary.

🧪 Bonus: DuckDB Hybrid Strategy

Since you’re already using DuckDB:

• Fetch raw chunks from MongoDB.
• Cache enriched `correlationId → sendersReference` in DuckDB.
• Join in DuckDB using SQL — blazing fast in-memory.
